# MicroPriceIndicator
This repository serves to replicate the results listed in the paper by Sasha Stoikov - The Micro-Price. As opposed to data used in the paper for US equities BAC and CVX, I am using the data for the Crypto pair TRXBTC. The data was pulled by me from Binance by subscribing to three different streams - Market Trades, Partial Depth and OrderbookSnapshot. Then these were combined to form the order-book and analysis done on the same.
